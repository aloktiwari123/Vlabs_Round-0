#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept DSB/SSB amplitude modulation and they will learn how to determine its modulation factor,they will come to know how to use DSB/SSB transmitters learn about its circuit diagram and how thw modulation occurs and helpfull.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Amplitude,Vmax,Vmin and will give Modulation index,and total power | This will test give the result of the experiment 
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
